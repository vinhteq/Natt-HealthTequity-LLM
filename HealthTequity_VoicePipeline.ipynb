        "This notebook presents a modular voice pipeline for bilingual (Spanish–English) processing and evaluation. The system performs the following sequence:\n",
        "1) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) on Spanish audio inputs (Whisper base).  \n",
        "2) Machine translation (Spanish → English) for downstream analysis.  \n",
        "3) Question answering over a tabular blood-pressure dataset using an LLM (GPT-40).  \n",
        "4) Back-translation to Spanish followed by text-to-speech (TTS).  \n",
        "5) Re-transcription of the generated Spanish audio using ASR and evaluation (WER, CER, SER).\n",
        "\n",
        "All steps are clearly separated, reproducible, and designed to be executed independently.\n"
